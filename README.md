Hi there! I am Carlo, I work in AI, Blockchain, and Space technologies. Here are some of my open-source works. 


## AI

[Efficient Neural Networks](https://github.com/carlodizon03/Efficient-Nets-on-Pytorch)  - Implementation of efficient neural networks on Pytorch with training and inference results using CamVid Dataset


[MobileNet-V2](https://github.com/carlodizon03/MobilenetV2-Pytorch) - Implementation of MobileNet-v2 on Pytorch

[FibNet](https://github.com/carlodizon03/FibNet) - My thesis project. Inspired by developing a neural network that can be scaled from tiny to large amount of trainable parameters while preserving the inference quality. I combined the scaling nature of Fibonacci Sequence and Logistic Equation principles to scale and abstract the neural network.

[MobileNet-V2 OpenCL](https://github.com/carlodizon03/MobileNetV2-OpenCL) - Implementation of MobileNet-V2 on OpenCL to be deployed in FPGA chip that was used in a satellite remote sensing payload. 

## Blockchain 

These are my open-souce works in [Hive.io](https://hive.io/) ecosystem

[Hive Multisig SDK](https://github.com/hive-keychain/hive-multisig-sdk) - An SDK that simplifies the creation of multisig transaction feature of Hive Blockchain.

[Hive Multisig Frontend](https://github.com/hive-keychain/hive-multisig-frontend) - A frontend that implements the Multisig SDK where users can perform multi-signature transactions.

[HBD Wallet](https://github.com/carlodizon03/hbd-wallet) - (Work-in-progress) A frontend where users can make HBD transactions and analyze their HBD savings all in one dashboard. [What is HBD Savings?](https://hive.io/hbd/#:~:text=%2C%20Hive%20Keychain-,Savings%20account%20APR,-Placing%20your%20HBD)

## Space
[Satoro Space](https://www.satoro.space/) - A startup company where I co-founded and currently work full-time as a Lead Ground Segment Software Engineer. 

[Spatellite to YouTube Streaming](https://www.youtube.com/@SATORO-taurus) - A YouTube streaming feature of our satellite. Our satellite utilizes a global network of ground sations to stream the video directly to YouTube. 

## Data Science

[Basic Mining Homeworks](https://github.com/carlodizon03/Data-Science) - Some homework stuff

## Science Fun

[Chaos Theory](https://github.com/carlodizon03/Chaos-Logistic-Difference-Equations) - Fun implementation of this [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/261459a0) from the 1976
